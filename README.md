# TDD-Example-Calculator-JavaTestUnit
This project serves as an example of Test-Driven Development (TDD) by implementing a simple calculator in Java using JUnit for unit testing. Test-Driven Development is a software development approach where tests are written before the actual code, guiding the implementation process and ensuring code correctness.
