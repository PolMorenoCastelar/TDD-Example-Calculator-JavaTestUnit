# TDD-Example-Calculator-JavaTestUnit
This project serves as an example of Test-Driven Development (TDD) by implementing a simple calculator in Java using JUnit for unit testing. Test-Driven Development is a software development approach where tests are written before the actual code, guiding the implementation process and ensuring code correctness.

Key Features:
Test-Driven Development (TDD): Demonstrates the TDD approach where tests are written first to define the desired behavior of the calculator functionality.

Basic Arithmetic Operations: Implement basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

JUnit Testing: Utilize JUnit, a popular Java testing framework, to write and execute unit tests for each functionality of the calculator.
